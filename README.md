# UFood Marketing Analysis
![Tableau Dashboard](Tableau%20Dashboard.png)

## Project Objectives | Business Questions
- What are some trends in UFood Sales across the different sales methods?
- Are there certain demographics to target in order to increase growth perspective?
- Based on findings what demographic will result in the most sales?

## Summary of Insights
1. Customers between the ages of 30-70 were spending more money compared to others. However, they were not accepting campaigns at a high rate. 
2. Those who purchased products through the catalog were more likeley to accept campaigns offered to them. However, in-person sales contributed significantly more to revenue than catalogs did.
3. Customers with less kids spent more than those with kids. In comparison, those with zero kids spent 43% more than customers with one kid, and as the number of children increased the amount spent dropped significantly.
4. Those with bachelor's degree made up the greatest number of purchases; however, those with different levels of education were not far behind and those with bachelor's degrees had a much larger population compared to others. Therefore, education didn't have as large of an impact as it seemed.
5. Similar to education, marital status had little impact on sales and revenue.
6. Finally, as age increased purchases had a minor increase and should be included when looking for demographic to target.
## Recommendations
1. In order to make the most amount of money to increase profit growth perspective as quickly as possible. We want to target middle aged customers, that have an above mean income, with zero to one child. From the data, these customers have created the most amount of money for the company and have the highest margins. To begin, I would split our targeting of this demograhic by 40% catalogs, 30% website, and 30% in-store. Catalogs have the highest number of accepted campaigns we just need to find a solution to the lower number of sales coming from these acceptances. On the other hand, our website and in-store are bringing in more revenue, but the campaign acceptance rates are not at the rate we want currently.

2. For long term profit growth perspective increase we need to work on the groups that are currently contributing to the least amount of sales. From the findings, those between the ages of 21-30 and 70+ are the demographic we need to target. Statistically these customers are accepting campaigns at a high rate, but are not spending as much as the other demographic. Similar to the other recommendation, we want to split the campaigns relatively evenly between the three sales methods. Although, it may be beneficial to lower the campaigns sent through catalog to customers under the age of 30 as they are accepting these less than campaigns offered through the website or in-store.
